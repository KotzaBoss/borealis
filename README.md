# BOREALIS

Borealis is meant to be an interactive supplementary program to the incredible <u>[Aurora Builder](https://aurorabuilder.com/)</u> which inspired it.
The primary idea is to give the user a handy "real-time" assistant when they play DnD. From creating, saving, loading characters on the fly,
leveling them up, engaging in combat and so on.  
While Aurora is the "sit-down-relax" companion, Borealis will be the "in-the-trenches" ally.
